### Basic Syntactic Mutation ###

The Basic Syntactic Mutation (BSM) procedure consists of inference rules such as *Coalesce*, *Split*, *Imit*, *MuConflict*, and *ImitCycle*. We have implemented the procedure in [Maude](http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/), a high performance reflective language.


### Prerequisites ###
To run the algorithm you will need to have installed Maude. 

### Install ###
Download and install Maude from here [Download Maude](http://maude.cs.illinois.edu/w/index.php?title=The_Maude_System).

### Instructions to run the program ###
Download .maude files to a directory. Run the maude on your machine and navigate to directory where the files reside in. 

# Load the file using the following command #

 ``` **Load** _filename.maude_ . ```



 ```red in myBSMp : bsmUnify ( p , rws, Empty, 0, none ) .```
